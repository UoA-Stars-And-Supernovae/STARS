# Cambridge STARS Code

This is the main repository for the *Cambridge STARS Code* that is in use by Jan Eldridge's Research Group, "Stars 'n' Supernovae".

It is based off code originally written by Peter Eggleton, [original code here](https://people.ast.cam.ac.uk/~stars/#download).

## Documentation

I'm slowly cobbling together an operation manual [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/qgtbhrgpwhqn) (email me if you want to collab on it :))

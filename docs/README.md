# Documentation

This documentation is firstly a rewrite of the [documentation by Warrick Ball](https://people.ast.cam.ac.uk/~stars/doc/stars.pdf) for `bs2008`. That documentation is in draft mode and not-quite-completed, whereas this goes into more detail in order to explain the core features such as input physics. It is currently a WIP.

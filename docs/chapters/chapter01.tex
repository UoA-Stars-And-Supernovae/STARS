The Cambridge STARS code was first written in 1971, by Peter Eggleton. Since then, several modifications have been made, resulting in the code being sourced in different places, documentation being incomplete, and different parameters being added in different areas. In 2021, an effort was made by Stars and Supernovae, the research group of Associate Professor Jan Eldridge. to unify these sources to modernise the codebase and rewrite the documentation. This document is the result of work by, and the collaborate effort of, several members of that group. In no particular order:
